### 3D Printing

I'm an elevator constructor and electrician by trade but have always wanted to be an inventor, to make things and experiment with electronics.

When I saw the reprap project for the first time and how the plans for these awesome machines were open-source and available for the masses, I was hooked.

I started 3D printing back in 2012 sending my STL files to 3rd party print services. Bought my first 3D printer in 2015, a Lulzbot Taz 5. For my first machine I wanted something open source in the same vein as the RepRap project and that would be a workhorse with a large print volume. The Taz 5 did not disappoint. 5 Years later she's still running strong with the exception of a few worn igus bushings and gt2 belts that needed replacing.

The Octoprint plug-in was never completed but works well for my personal use. I'd like to eventually add more functionality to the plug-in and make it worthy of publishing to the Plug-In Repository.
