### 3D Printing

[Check out my Designs on Thingiverse!](https://www.thingiverse.com/JimbalNy/designs)

I'm an elevator constructor and electrician by day, Nerd by night. I've always been interested in invention, tinkering with electronics and programming but still love getting my hands dirty and making stuff work with these heavily calloused hands. I thought I could find that mix of disciplines being an Electrician but the work was repetitive and money wasn't all that great. Elevator construction is where I've found that so many different disciplines I love really intersect.

When I saw the reprap project for the first time and how the plans for these awesome machines were open-source and available for the masses, I was hooked.

I started 3D printing back in 2012 sending my STL files to 3rd party print services. Bought my first 3D printer in 2015, a Lulzbot Taz 5. For my first machine I wanted something open source in the same vein as the RepRap project and that would be a workhorse with a large print volume. The Taz 5 did not disappoint. 5 Years later she's still running strong with the exception of a few worn igus bushings and gt2 belts that needed replacing.



## Current projects

### **Taz 5 SKR 1.4 Turbo Upgrade**

Replacing the Rambo board in the Taz 5 with the 32 bit SKR 1.4 Turbo.

**Current Progress:**

> - [x] Firmware modifications (Marlin 2.0.x)
> - [ ] Design new control box enclosure *(In Progress)*
> - [ ] Wiring and board replacement
> - [ ] Test and first prints

**Enclosure Preview:**

### **Octoprint Membrane Keypad 3D Printer Control Plug-In**

![Membrane keypad](https://jimbalny.github.io/images/keypad.jpg)

> [Octoprint Plug-In GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jimbalny/Octoprint-MembraneKeypad)

> [Files to 3D print on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3815645)

Uses a cheap (~$5) 3x4 Membrane keypad, some 3d printed parts and a recycled cat6 patch cable to control a 3d printer over Octoprint. For example, jog X Y and Z axis, start or cancel prints, Extrude or Retract filament, etc.

The Octoprint plug-in was never completed but works well for my personal use. I'd like to eventually add more functionality to the plug-in and make it worthy of publishing to the Plug-In Repository.
