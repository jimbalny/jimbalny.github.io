### 3D Printing

I'm an elevator constructor and electrician by trade but have always wanted to be an inventor, to make things and experiment with electronics. When I saw the reprap project for the first time and how the plans for these awesome machines were open-source and available for the masses, I was hooked. I started 3D printing back in 2012 sending my STL files to 3rd party print services. Bought my first 3D printer in 2015, a Lulzbot Taz 5. For my first machine I wanted something solid, open source for future upgrades, and would be a workhorse with a large print volume, the Taz 5 did not disappoint.
